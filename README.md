# Fenwick-Tree

A Fenwick tree or BIT (Binary Indexed Tree) is a data structure that can efficiently calculate prefix sums in a table of numbers. The tree structure allows operations to be performed using only O(log n) node accesses.

This is how sums are stored in the bit array :

For instance, bit[12] stores the sum of elements from arr[9] to arr[12].
